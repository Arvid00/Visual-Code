    <mark><i><b>There's</b></i></mark> much written on <ins>www</ins> about history of the <dfn>Internet</dfn>. For example, about the first graphical Internet browser on the web - <abbr title="first web browser">Mosaic</abbr>.
<blockquote><q>Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical World<sub>Wide Web browser</sub>, released on April <sup>22, 1993</sup> by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.</q></blockquote> A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later. Today's Internet browsers we use today (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.), got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.
